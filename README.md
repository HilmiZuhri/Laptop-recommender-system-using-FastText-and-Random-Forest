# 📌 Laptop Recommendation System Using NLP with FastText and Random Forest

## 📖 Project Description

This project implements a **Laptop Recommendation System** based on **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. It utilizes **FastText** for text representation (*word embedding*) and **Random Forest** as the classification algorithm.

The system classifies user needs based on textual input and recommends the most suitable laptop category, such as:

* Gaming
* Multimedia
* Office
* Programming
* Workstation

The predicted category is then used to filter and display relevant laptop recommendations.

## 🎯 Research Objectives

1. To develop a text-based laptop needs classification system.
2. To implement FastText for transforming textual input into numerical vector representations.
3. To apply Random Forest for category classification.
4. To evaluate model performance using quantitative metrics:

   * Accuracy
   * Precision
   * Recall
   * F1-Score
   * Cross-Validation

---

## 🧠 Methodology

This research applies a **quantitative experimental approach**, consisting of the following stages:

1. Dataset collection of laptop requirement descriptions.
2. Text preprocessing (case folding and text cleaning).
3. FastText model training to generate sentence embeddings.
4. Random Forest model training for classification.
5. Model evaluation using k-fold cross-validation.
6. Deployment into a web-based system (PHP frontend + Flask API backend).

## 📊 Model Evaluation Results

The model was evaluated using **5-Fold Cross Validation**, achieving the following average performance:

```
Mean Accuracy: 97.42%
Standard Deviation: 0.0241
```

The results indicate that the model performs consistently and reliably in classifying laptop requirements based on textual descriptions.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

Large machine learning model files such as:

* `fasttext_model.bin`
* `model_rf.pkl`

are excluded from this repository due to file size limitations.
The models can be regenerated by running the provided training scripts.

## 🚀 How to Run the System

### 1️⃣ Run the Flask API

```bash
python app.py
```

The API will run at:

```
http://localhost:5000/predict
```

---

### 2️⃣ Run the PHP Web Application

Place the `web` folder inside your local server directory (e.g., XAMPP or Laragon), then access it through your browser.

## 🎓 Academic Context

This project was developed as part of an undergraduate thesis in Computer Science, focusing on the implementation of NLP techniques for text-based recommendation systems.

If you would like, I can also create:

* A more **research-paper styled version** (for academic submission)
* A more **technical portfolio-focused version**
* Or a shorter, cleaner version optimized for GitHub recruiters**

Just tell me which one you prefer 👍
